# html-ppt — HTML PPT Studio

Author professional HTML presentations as static files. One theme file = one
look. One layout file = one page type. One animation class = one entry effect.
All pages share a token-based design system in `assets/base.css`.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/lewislulu/html-ppt-skill
```

One command, no build. Pure static HTML/CSS/JS with only CDN webfonts.

No network on the target machine? Point the CLI at a local copy
(`npx skills add ./html-ppt-skill`), or just copy this folder into your agent's
skills directory — `~/.claude/skills/html-ppt/` for Claude Code. Decks render
offline; only the webfonts fall back to the system stack. See
[README.md](README.md#offline--manual-install).

## What the skill gives you

- **36 themes** (`assets/themes/*.css`) — minimal-white, editorial-serif, soft-pastel, sharp-mono, arctic-cool, sunset-warm, catppuccin-latte/mocha, dracula, tokyo-night, nord, solarized-light, gruvbox-dark, rose-pine, neo-brutalism, glassmorphism, bauhaus, swiss-grid, terminal-green, xiaohongshu-white, rainbow-gradient, aurora, blueprint, memphis-pop, cyberpunk-neon, y2k-chrome, retro-tv, japanese-minimal, vaporwave, midcentury, corporate-clean, academic-paper, news-broadcast, pitch-deck-vc, magazine-bold, engineering-whiteprint
- **15 full-deck templates** (`templates/full-decks/<name>/`) — complete multi-slide decks with scoped `.tpl-<name>` CSS. 8 extracted from real-world decks (xhs-white-editorial, graphify-dark-graph, knowledge-arch-blueprint, hermes-cyber-terminal, obsidian-claude-gradient, testing-safety-alert, xhs-pastel-card, dir-key-nav-minimal), 7 scenario scaffolds (pitch-deck, product-launch, tech-sharing, weekly-report, xhs-post 3:4, course-module, **presenter-mode-reveal** — 演讲者模式专用)
- **36 layouts** (`templates/single-page/*.html`) with realistic demo data, including **5 real-image layouts** (single / full-bleed / image+text / gallery / before-after)
- **27 CSS animations** (`assets/animations/animations.css`) via `data-anim`
- **20 canvas FX animations** (`assets/animations/fx/*.js`) via `data-fx` — particle-burst, confetti-cannon, firework, starfield, matrix-rain, knowledge-graph (force-directed), neural-net (pulses), constellation, orbit-ring, galaxy-swirl, word-cascade, letter-explode, chain-react, magnetic-field, data-stream, gradient-blob, sparkle-trail, shockwave, typewriter-multi, counter-explosion
- **Keyboard runtime** (`assets/runtime.js`) — arrows, T (theme), A (anim), F/O, **S (presenter mode: magnetic-card popup with CURRENT / NEXT / SCRIPT / TIMER cards)**, N (notes drawer), R (reset timer in presenter)
- **Touch navigation** — swipe left/right to change slides on phones and tablets
- **FX runtime** (`assets/animations/fx-runtime.js`) — auto-inits `[data-fx]` on slide enter, cleans up on leave
- **Showcase decks** for themes / layouts / animations / full-decks gallery
- **Headless Chrome render script** for PNG export

## When to use

Use when the user asks for any kind of slide-based output or wants to turn
text/notes into a presentable deck. Prefer this over building from scratch.

### 🎤 Presenter Mode (演讲者模式 + 逐字稿)

If the user mentions any of: **演讲 / 分享 / 讲稿 / 逐字稿 / speaker notes / presenter view / 演讲者视图 / 提词器**, or says things like "我要去给团队讲 xxx", "要做一场技术分享", "怕讲不流畅", "想要一份带逐字稿的 PPT" — **use the `presenter-mode-reveal` full-deck template** and write 150–300 words of 逐字稿 in each slide's `<aside class="notes">`.

See [references/presenter-mode.md](references/presenter-mode.md) for the full authoring guide including the 3 rules of speaker script writing:
1. **不是讲稿，是提示信号** — 加粗核心词 + 过渡句独立成段
2. **每页 150–300 字** — 2–3 分钟/页的节奏
3. **用口语，不用书面语** — "因此"→"所以"，"该方案"→"这个方案"

All full-deck templates support the S key presenter mode (it's built into `runtime.js`). **S opens a new popup window with 4 magnetic cards**:
- 🔵 **CURRENT** — pixel-perfect iframe preview of the current slide
- 🟣 **NEXT** — pixel-perfect iframe preview of the next slide
- 🟠 **SPEAKER SCRIPT** — large-font 逐字稿 (scrollable)
- 🟢 **TIMER** — elapsed time + slide counter + prev/next/reset buttons

Each card is **draggable by its header** and **resizable by the bottom-right corner handle**. Card positions/sizes persist to `localStorage` per deck. A "Reset layout" button restores the default arrangement.

**Why the previews are pixel-perfect**: each preview is an `<iframe>` that loads the actual deck HTML with a `?preview=N` query param; `runtime.js` detects this and renders only slide N with no chrome. So the preview uses the **same CSS, theme, fonts, and viewport as the audience view** — colors and layout are guaranteed identical.

**Smooth navigation**: on slide change, the presenter window sends `postMessage({type:'preview-goto', idx:N})` to each iframe. The iframe just toggles `.is-active` between slides — **no reload, no flicker**. The two windows also stay in sync via `BroadcastChannel`.

Only `presenter-mode-reveal` is designed from the ground up around the feature with proper example 逐字稿 on every slide.

Keyboard in presenter window: `← →` navigate (syncs audience) · `R` reset timer · `Esc` close popup.
Keyboard in audience window: `S` open presenter · `T` cycle theme · `← →` navigate (syncs presenter) · `F` fullscreen · `O` overview.

## Before you author anything — ALWAYS ask or recommend

**Do not start writing slides until you understand three things.** Either ask
the user directly, or — if they already handed you rich content — propose a
tasteful default and confirm.

1. **Content & audience.** What's the deck about, how many slides, who's
   watching (engineers / execs / 小红书读者 / 学生 / VC)?
2. **Style / theme.** Which of the 36 themes fits? If unsure, recommend 2-3
   candidates based on tone:
   - Business / investor pitch → `pitch-deck-vc`, `corporate-clean`, `swiss-grid`
   - Tech sharing / engineering → `tokyo-night`, `dracula`, `catppuccin-mocha`,
     `terminal-green`, `blueprint`
   - 小红书图文 → `xiaohongshu-white`, `soft-pastel`, `rainbow-gradient`,
     `magazine-bold`
   - Academic / report → `academic-paper`, `editorial-serif`, `minimal-white`
   - Edgy / cyber / launch → `cyberpunk-neon`, `vaporwave`, `y2k-chrome`,
     `neo-brutalism`
3. **Starting point.** One of the 15 full-deck templates, or scratch? Point
   to the closest `templates/full-decks/<name>/` and ask if it fits. If the
   user's content suggests something obvious (e.g. "我要做产品发布会" →
   `product-launch`), propose it confidently instead of asking blindly.

A good opening message looks like:

> 我可以给你做这份 PPT！先确认三件事：
> 1. 大致内容 / 页数 / 观众是谁？
> 2. 风格偏好？我建议从这 3 个主题里选一个：`tokyo-night`（技术分享默认好看）、`xiaohongshu-white`（小红书风）、`corporate-clean`（正式汇报）。
> 3. 要不要用我现成的 `tech-sharing` 全 deck 模板打底？

Only after those are clear, scaffold the deck and start writing.

## Quick start

1. **Scaffold a new deck.** From the repo root:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/new-deck.sh my-talk
   open examples/my-talk/index.html
   ```
2. **Pick a theme.** Open the deck and press `T` to cycle. Or hard-code it
   (`../assets/` here is a placeholder — use whatever prefix the rest of the
   file already uses; `new-deck.sh` has set it to the right depth):
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" id="theme-link" href="../assets/themes/aurora.css">
   ```
   Catalog in [references/themes.md](references/themes.md).
3. **Pick layouts.** Copy `<section class="slide">...</section>` blocks out of
   files in `templates/single-page/` into your deck. Replace the demo data.
   Catalog in [references/layouts.md](references/layouts.md).
4. **Add animations.** Put `data-anim="fade-up"` (or `class="anim-fade-up"`) on
   any element. On `<ul>`/grids, use `anim-stagger-list` for sequenced reveals.
   For canvas FX, use `<div data-fx="knowledge-graph">...</div>` and include
   `<script src="../assets/animations/fx-runtime.js"></script>`.
   Catalog in [references/animations.md](references/animations.md).
5. **Use a full-deck template.** Scaffold from it, don't copy it by hand —
   the template's `../../../assets/` is relative to *its own* location, so a
   manual copy lands the paths at the wrong depth:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/new-deck.sh my-talk -t pitch-deck
   ```
   Each folder is self-contained with scoped CSS. Catalog in
   [references/full-decks.md](references/full-decks.md) and gallery at
   `templates/full-decks-index.html`.
6. **Render to PNG.**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/render.sh templates/theme-showcase.html       # one shot
   ./scripts/render.sh examples/my-talk/index.html 12      # 12 slides
   ```

## Authoring rules (important)

- **Always start from a template.** Don't author slides from scratch — copy the
  closest layout from `templates/single-page/` first, then replace content.
- **Use tokens, not literal colors.** Every color, radius, shadow should come
  from CSS variables defined in `assets/base.css` and overridden by a theme.
  Good: `color: var(--text-1)`. Bad: `color: #111`.
  Text on top of an `--accent` fill is the one people get wrong: it needs
  `color: var(--accent-ink)`, because accents here run from `#ffffff` to
  `#000000` and no literal ink is readable on all of them.
- **Don't invent new layout files.** Prefer composing existing ones. Only add
  a new `templates/single-page/*.html` if none of the 36 fit.
- **Putting images on a slide?** Start from one of the five `image-*` layouts and
  use `.img-frame` — see *Images* below. Never drop a bare `<img>` into a slide:
  an unframed image ignores the slide's height and pushes the rest off the page.
- **Respect chrome slots.** `.deck-header`, `.deck-footer`, `.slide-number`
  and the progress bar are provided by `assets/base.css` + `runtime.js`.
- **Add a logo declaratively, once.** Put `data-logo` on `<body>` — don't paste
  an `<img>` into every slide. See *Custom logo* below.
- **Keyboard-first.** Always include the runtime, e.g.
  `<script src="../assets/runtime.js"></script>`, so the deck supports
  ← → / T / A / F / S / O / hash deep-links.
- **Never hand-edit the `../` depth in asset paths.** Every `assets/` reference
  is relative to the file that holds it: `templates/deck.html` uses
  `../assets/`, `templates/single-page/*.html` use `../../assets/`, and
  `templates/full-decks/*/index.html` use `../../../assets/`. Copying a file to
  a new depth silently breaks all of them. Scaffold with
  `./scripts/new-deck.sh <name> [parent] [-t <template>]`, which computes the
  prefix for wherever the deck lands and verifies every reference resolves.
- **One `.slide` per logical page.** `runtime.js` makes `.slide.is-active`
  visible; all others are hidden.
- **Supply notes.** Wrap speaker notes in `<div class="notes">…</div>` inside
  each slide. Press S to open the overlay.
- **NEVER put presenter-only text on the slide itself.** Descriptive text like
  "这一页展示了……" or "Speaker: 这里可以补充……" or small explanatory captions
  aimed at the presenter MUST go inside `<div class="notes">`, NOT as visible
  `<p>` / `<span>` elements on the slide. The `.notes` class is `display:none`
  by default — it only appears in the S overlay. Slides should contain ONLY
  audience-facing content (titles, bullet points, data, charts, images).

## Images

Five layouts in `templates/single-page/` take real images. Pick by how many
images the page has to carry:

| I have… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| one screenshot / diagram / chart | `image-single.html` | `.img-frame.contain` — letterboxed, **never cropped** |
| one photo that should carry the page | `image-full-bleed.html` | fills the slide, gradient scrim keeps the title readable |
| one image plus an argument | `image-text-split.html` | 50/50; add `flip` to `.split` to move the image right |
| 3–6 images | `image-gallery.html` | uniform grid; mixed source ratios are normalised by the frame |
| a before and an after | `image-compare.html` | both sides identical size, conclusion under each |

`image-grid.html` and `image-hero.html` are **not** in this list: they are
gradient-placeholder layouts with no `<img>` at all. Reach for them when you
want the shape of a bento wall without supplying pictures.

All five are built on one primitive from `assets/base.css`:

```html
<figure class="img-frame"><img src="shot.png" alt=""></figure>
<figure class="img-frame contain" style="--img-ratio:4/3"><img src="diagram.svg" alt=""></figure>
```

- `.img-frame` owns the **aspect ratio and the crop**; the `<img>` fills it with
  `object-fit: cover`. That's what lets a user swap in a photo of any shape
  without the layout breaking.
- `.img-frame.contain` letterboxes instead of cropping — **always use it for
  screenshots, diagrams and logos.**
- `--img-ratio` (default `16/10`) and `--img-pos` (`object-position`) tune it.
- `.img-scrim` / `.img-cap` / `.img-tag` are the scrim, caption and corner pill.
- Images referenced from a deck are resolved relative to the deck's own
  `index.html` — keep them in the deck folder, e.g. `examples/my-talk/shot.png`.
- `assets/demo-images/` holds the placeholder artwork used by these layouts:
  hand-written SVG, ~1 KB each, **no network needed**.

## Custom logo

To brand a deck with a company / product logo, declare it once on `<body>`:

```html
<body data-logo="logo.svg"
      data-logo-position="bottom-right"
      data-logo-size="40px">
```

| Attribute | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data-logo` | — | Image URL, relative to the deck's own HTML file. Required. |
| `data-logo-position` | `top-right` | `top-left` / `top-right` / `bottom-left` / `bottom-right` |
| `data-logo-size` | `44px` | Any CSS length; sets the logo's **height**, width follows the aspect ratio |
| `data-logo-opacity` | `.9` | `1` for full strength |
| `data-logo-alt` | `""` | Alt text |

- **Skip it on one slide** with `<section class="slide" data-no-logo>` — usually
  the cover and any full-bleed image slide that carries its own branding.
- **Fine-tune the inset** with `--logo-inset-x` / `--logo-inset-y` on `.deck-logo`.
- **Place it by hand** instead, if you want it inside the chrome slots or in a
  spot the four presets don't cover:
  ```html
  <div class="deck">
    <img class="deck-logo" data-pos="bottom-left" src="logo.svg" alt="">
  ```
  This path needs no JS at all — `base.css` styles both the same way.
- The logo shows in the **presenter preview**, and on **every page of a
  print/PDF export** (unlike the header/footer/progress chrome, which print
  hides). `data-no-logo` slides are skipped there too. Per-page printing is
  painted by `runtime.js` + `@media print`; a deck that omits the runtime still
  gets the logo on screen, but only on one page of a PDF.

## Rendering to PNG

`scripts/render.sh` wraps headless Chrome at
`/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`. For multi-slide
capture, runtime.js exposes `#/N` deep-links, and render.sh iterates 1..N.

```bash
./scripts/render.sh templates/single-page/kpi-grid.html        # single page
./scripts/render.sh examples/demo-deck/index.html 8 out-dir    # 8 slides, custom dir
```
